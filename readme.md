Item 2 (training) was done in a Mac with an Intel core due to version conflicts that occurred with Apple Silicon and TensorFlow-related packages at the time the project was completed (2023).

Remaining processes are not dependent on the type of Mac hardware. In the uploaded version, items 1 and 3 (labeling and mapping) were done on Silicon Mac.

The two .ipynb files (one each from items 1 and 2) were originally created by Nicholas Renotte (https://github.com/nicknochnack/TFODCourse). Subsequent modifications were made for the following main purposes:
1) Source and format the images from a designated directory instead of using a webcam.
2) Resolve version conflicts.
3) Create custom object classes and modify training settings.
